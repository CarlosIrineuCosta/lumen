# Lumen UI Requirements

## Glass Insights
- **Black interface** with white text (no gray backgrounds)
- **Private appreciation system** - counts never public
- **Member cards** show avatar + 3 recent photo thumbnails
- **No vanity metrics** - engagement invisible to reduce social pressure
- **Chronological feeds** - no algorithmic manipulation

## Your Requirements
- Max 3 tags per photo (semantic categories)
- Client-side B&W detection (Canvas API, no AI costs)
- Lateral navigation maintains context (swipe through feed/discover/profile)
- Private comments for connected users only
- Tag validation prevents impossible combinations (Urban+Boudoir)

## Bottom Navigation (To Be Revised)
Current placeholder icons:
- 🏠 Home - Chronological feed from followed photographers
- 🔍 Discover - Grid of all recent uploads
- 👤 Profile - Your portfolio and settings
- 🔔 Notifications - Appreciations and comments

These will be redesigned based on your feedback tomorrow.

## Key Differentiators
- Professional focus (equipment tracking, collaborations)
- No ads ever
- Quality over engagement
- Photographer-owned platform
