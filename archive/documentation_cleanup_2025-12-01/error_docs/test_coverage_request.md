# Test Coverage Analysis Request

**Assigned to**: GLM (glm-4.5-flash)
**Priority**: High
**Scope**: Entire Lumen project

## Task Requirements

1. **Inventory all test files**:
   - Python tests (backend/tests/, scripts/tests/)
   - JavaScript tests (if any)
   - Playwright UI tests
   - Performance tests

2. **Analyze test coverage**:
   - Which modules are tested
   - Coverage percentage estimation
   - Critical modules without tests
   - Test types per module

3. **Evaluate test infrastructure**:
   - Test configuration files
   - Test data and fixtures
   - CI/CD integration
   - Test reporting

4. **Identify gaps**:
   - Missing unit tests
   - Missing integration tests
   - Untested API endpoints
   - Edge cases not covered

## Output Format

Provide a structured analysis that includes:
- Test inventory with file paths
- Coverage matrix
- Gap analysis
- Recommendations for improving test coverage
