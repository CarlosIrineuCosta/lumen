# Tasks for 2024-09-19

## High Priority

- [x] Set up multi-agent orchestration system
- [ ] Fix authentication issue with email login
- [ ] Complete photo upload feature implementation

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Update documentation for recent changes
- [ ] Run full test suite on backend
- [ ] Migrate photo-viewer component from React to Web Components

## Low Priority

- [ ] Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] Performance optimizations for image loading

## Notes

- Focus on completing one task fully before moving to the next
- Run verification after each task completion: `python scripts/agent_protocol.py verify`
- Update this file throughout the day
- Gemini follow-up: config issue resolved; pending choice to run fast unit subset or full 600-test suite per latest message (options A vs B). Return to this before restarting tests.
- Auth modal wiring restored (LumenUI dialog flow) pending local verification once Gemini run completes.
- Firebase emulator conflict handled by new `firebase.test.json` (ports 9290/9291/9499) and updated `scripts/run-full-test-suite.sh`. Rerun suite with that config; capture `--debug` logs if emulators still refuse to start.
- Users schema now includes birth_date/country_code/tos_accepted_at + subscription fields; photos table and `series` table definitions restored. Drop & recreate `lumen_test` with updated `backend/schema_production.sql` before the next full suite.
- Seed script updated to populate required user compliance fields; rerun `scripts/seed_test_data.py` after rebuilding the database.
- Photo stack: CRUD/search endpoints now pass through module-level shims; remaining work limited to search response stubbing & Photo model helpers tolerating mocks.

## End-of-Day Focus

- [ ] Run a manual smoke of login → gallery → upload to confirm the freshly restored app path works and record any regressions.
- [ ] Stage the Gemini test handoff by documenting the exact suites/fixtures to run and any data seeding steps once it comes back online.
- [ ] Log findings and blockers in `docs/tasks_2025-10-05.md` and `.postbox/todo.md` so the next pass picks up with the latest context.
