# Lumen Prototype - Archive Summary

**Date Created**: Weekend Development (early August 2025)
**Purpose**: UI/UX exploration for professional photography gallery

## Key Concepts Extracted

### 1. People-First Discovery Philosophy
Instead of 500px's "similar images" approach, focus on WHO took the photo:
- Every image hover shows photographer info prominently
- Discovery modes: Photographers, Models, Nearby, Open for Work
- "Connect" button promotes networking over browsing

### 2. Justified Gallery Implementation
- Exact same mosaic layout library as 500px
- Respects image proportions without forcing squares
- Performance optimized with lazy loading
- Smooth hover effects

### 3. Cleaner Interface Design
- No overwhelming options (removed duplicate galleries, similar photos)
- Dark theme optimized for photo viewing
- Montserrat/Roboto fonts for sophistication
- Mobile-first responsive design

### 4. Discovery Mode Categories
- **Latest Work**: Chronological feed
- **Photographers**: Browse by photographer profiles
- **Models**: Dedicated model discovery
- **Nearby (30km)**: GPS-based local networking
- **Open for Work**: Collaboration opportunities
